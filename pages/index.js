        <p>Hello! I am Jello. You can call me Jel in short and I am an aspiring software developer.</p>
        <p>My expectations to TwistResources is that it is a company that will aide my learning and career growth.
          I am expecting to learn a lot not only in the aspect of coding but with the whole process of the software development.
        </p>
        <p>My impression so far for TwistResources is that it have a very nice environment full of nice people. 
          As for the learning path scheduled for the upcoming days, it piqued my interest and I am very excited to have the lessons.
